Sources of risks:
- inclement weather such as lightning, rain, fog, flash floods, blizzards, tornadoes
- hazardous terrain such as avalanches, landslides, rockfalls, icefalls, forest fires
- slips on wet rocks or logs, crossing water bodies (in the case of poor visibility, uneven surfaces, strong currents, algae-covered rocks, 
- loose materials such as loose gravel
- drownings (usually when accompanied by head injuries)
- very cold water which can quickly sap energy
- becoming lost (lost hikers who cannot find their way to their destination on time may run out of food and water, or experience a change in weather)

Other sources of accidents:
- dehydration
- sodium deficiency from sweating
- low blood sugar for diabetics
- hypothermia
- heat exhaustion
- altitude sickness developing into high altitude pulmonary edema, or high altitude cerebral edema
- carbon monoxide poisoning
- frostbite
- sunburn
- snow blindness

Internal Injuries suchas ankle sprains, foot blisters and back injuries
Animal bites such as snakes, scorpions, spiders and bees that may cause anaphylactic shock

Partnership for Safety
- Using Houndify, provide hands-free guides on segments, giving the athlete more time to focus on the activity
- point on points of interests, hazards, etc
- using the Strava Beacon feature, automatically call for help in case of an incidence
- concussion protocol?
- emergency services alert protocol?
- emergency contact protocol?

for athletes who travel and may not necessarily know the emergency number to dial in case of an incidence, our system can automatically connect to the emergency services

auto-dial 112 in europe, etc

talk about story of passing out while mountain biking and being knocked out

## Strava Beacon
Share location in real time (location, moving time, battery level, etc)

# Strava Performance Coaching and Tracking
HR, cadence, power, running speed, running cadence, elevation gain, distance, etc

# Strava Segments
voice guide on segments, points of interests, hazard spots, KOM splits
(world's largest route and trail resource)
