## Background
According to the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment in England, about 60% of the adult population (age 14 years and older) participate in outdoor recreational activities such as cycling, running, and trekking each month.

Meanwhile, the U.S National Center for Injury Prevention and Control estimates that the main causes of injury during outdoor recreational activities can be attributed to:
- falls (~48% of all injuries)
- overexertion (~10% of all injuries)
- other, such as environmental and natural hazards, drowning, bites, etc (~24% of all injuries)

In recent years, [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), the world's largest social network for athletes (with over 50 million athletes in 195 countries) has developed several safety features in its app for athletes. The [Strava Beacon feature](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/224357527-Strava-Beacon) shares an athletes location, moving time, and battery level with the athlete's emergency contact. Additionaly, Strava users can use the [Segments feature](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918167-Strava-Segments) to discover new routes and trails.

## Partnership for Safety
The Houndify platform provides a wealth of features that can be combined with Strava to not only improve athlete safety, but also drive engagement with the app.
Given the nature of outdoor activities and their associated risk elements such as:
- falls
- inclement weather
- hazardous terrain
- altitude sickness
- dehydration
- loss of orientation

most athletes are not able to physically interact with their phones while outdoors.

As such, a voice user interface can be valuable in these conditions since it can provide a hands-free medium of interaction, and thus give the athlete more time to focus on the activity. 

Further, such an interface can quickly alert an athlete to points of interests, hazards, and even guide the athlete through unknown segments or terrains. In case of emergency, such as a detected fall, immobility or inclement weather, the voice user interface can be configured to automatically call for help and/or alert the athlete's emergency contact, should the athlete be incapacitated, and thus unable to call for help.

## Partnership for Athletic Performance Monitoring and Coaching
With the Strava app, athletes can monitor vital statistics such as:
- heart rate
- power
- running speed
- running cadence
- cycling cadence
- elevation gain
- distance
and so on, thus providing detailed insights into the athlete's performance.

By leveraging the Houndify platform and the Strava API, engineers can build new features such as voice coaches that can guide an athlete in real-time and provide feedback on her performance.

Further, health protocols, such as a concussion protocol can be built into the app to detect warning signs of a concussion such as:
- delayed responses (slow to answer questions or follow instructions)
- inattention (easily distracted or unable to follow conversations)
- slurred or incoherent speech (making disjointed or incomprehensible statements)
- inappropriate emotionally (appearing distraught, crying for no apparent reason)

and automatically call the appropriate medical services to intervene.

## Strava Stats
- ~1M new athletes / month 
- ~50M athlete activity uploads from 195 countries 
- ~400+ compatible mobile phones and GPS devices 
- ~19M activity uploads / week 
- ~25K new cycling and running segments / month with over 20M segments
