# Problems, Solutions & Requirements Gathering for Potential Partnership

## Directeur Sportif
### Number of Radios used during a typical grand tour
- 1 radio for communication with the Radio Tour
- 1 radio for communication with the team cars
- 1 radio for communication with the riders

"The technology that goes into the race radio is pretty ancient"

"We have a lot of trouble hearing. The riders have no trouble hearing me, but I have a lot of trouble hearing them, so it's an issue"

"To be honest, I probably hear at best 50% of what they say"

"For complicated conversations, it's better to pull up and have a chat with the rider"

"You cannot select who you speak to (riders). If you speak to one, you speak to all"

### Information Communicated
- change in wind direction
- technical descents
- hair pins
- lengths of climbs and gradients
- location of feed zones and heads up when approaching feed zones
- location of auxiliary feed zones
- gaps from the breaks

Greatest need is to communicate important information quickly and accurately

## Riders
- Radios help provide useful information during the race
- Allows us to take safety precautions when needed, such as oil on the roads, very technical descents, winds, etc
- Sometimes, one of your teammates radio might not work so you need to pass on information to other riders


## Race Radios from Radio Tour + Communication
In a race, such as the tour de France, there are generally
- 22 teams consisting of 8 riders in each team
- at least 2 team support vehicles
- dozens of support vehicles and motorcycles from the Race organizers
	- neutral race jury vehicles
	- neutral medical vehicles
	- neutral food and refreshments vehicles
	- neutral mechanical support vehicles
	- broom vehicles
- Race Organiser Vehicles including the Race Director vehicle and support vehicles
- Press and Media Vehicles and Motorcycles
- Race Motorcycles
- Local Police Vehicles

Radio communication from the race organizers is available to everyone in the race
- info to all parties on how the race is developing such as rider gaps, breakaways, crashes, abandons, mechanicals, emergencies, etc.

## Race Communication Protocol
Before the race, the Race Jury consults with each team to establish the team's unique team radio frequency for it's onboard radio system
- reduces radio communication interference (22 teams, 8 riders, dozens of support and race vehicles, media vehicles, etc, police radio, helicopter and tv radio, etc)
- prevvents other teams from listening in on another team's communications

In case of an incidence with a rider, such as a crash, mechanical, medical, etc, race director gives permission to directeur sportif or team vehicle to break out of the procession order (which is usually determined by the team's standing in the race) to speed up to the rider in need of assistance

Team cars are usually not allowed to break ouf of the procession order, unless they are given the clearance to do so, usually when a rider is in the breakway with a gap of at least 1 minute over the peloton

## Hazards of Radios for Riders:
Average rider radio weighs around 200 grams

Several riders such as Dan Martin and Vincenzo Nibali suffering spinal fracture injuries due to positioning of radio on the mid to upper back of the rider

Safety of Riders wearing Radio Packs
https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uec-wants-to-investigate-safety-of-riders-wearing-radio-packs-news-shorts/

Many riders like Tony Martin and Vincenzo Nibali suffered fractures to their spine while wearing radio packs.
Radio packs often taped to the mid to upper back of pro riders

Other riders such as Julien Alaphilippe crashing in a race due to a brief moment of inattention on the radio

### Riders against Race radios
Romain Bardet calling for a ban on Team Radios
https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/bardet-calls-for-ban-on-race-radios/
- would help make the race more unpredictable by elevating the rider as an athlete
- "I think a world without earpieces would be a very good thing. It would make the riders take a bit more responsibility. It would heighten their tactical sense and awareness. You'd have to be more alert to the race. I think it would elevate the rider as an athlete, not having that information," Bardet said.
- "For me personally, I find the earpieces make you that bit more passive, waiting for information before you make a move. Without them you're looking at who is where, you can't let dangerous riders out of your sight, and it makes the race a more intense experience, from within. It gives more uncertainty.
- "Often the information you get – 'be well-positioned at kilometre 80' and so on – with 180 riders all getting that in their ears, it can increase the risk of crashes as well."

Ironically, the same rider crashed on Stage 13 of this year's tour de france, and biked on after suffering a concussion
- Perhap a concussion protocol could be used when a rider crashes and takes a while to get up, in order to identify if the rider may be at risk for a concussion or not:
ex: Romain Bardet, chute sur la 13e étape du Tour 2020, commotion cerebrale => https://youtu.be/Me4eXCXLm2Y

ex: Mathieu van der Poel crash in Brugge de Panne with a concussion: => https://youtu.be/bmZ6_KgmbTk


## Current Technology
Usually Motorola Push to Talk Technology

https://www.motorolasolutions.com/content/dam/msi/docs/products/command-center-software/broadband-push-to-talk/ptt_technology_evolution_whitepaper_global.pdf

(set up radio channels ahead of time)
to communicate, push on button, speak, release button
- almost real-time
- around a 3 to 4 km radius


!! Solution can be expanded into other fields such as construction, warehousing logistics, oil and gas, emergency services, etc

Solution can also be used to improve rider's safety other than providing a hands-free, disruptive free, clear communication between riders and the race of the race participants

Example concussion protocols:

Some signs of concussion include:
- vacant stare
- delayed repsonses (slow to answer questions or follow instructions)
- inattention (easily distracted or unable to follow conversations)
- disorientation (walking in the wrong direction, unaware of time, date, pace)
- slurred or incoherent speech (making disjointed or incomprehensible statements)
- incoordination (stumbling, inability to walk tandem or a straight line)
- inappropriate emotionally (appearing distraught, crying for no apparent reason)
- memory problems
- loss of consciousness


communication channel in case of incidence
(riders, directeur sportifs, race helicopters, race motorcycle, race police, etc)
- need a way to detect a fall, launch a concussion protocol, while information of the incident is being relayed to the proper channels for intervention



## Some barriers to adoption of a new solution
1. Riders, who believe that using radios makes the race more predictable, and thus boring
2. Technology inertia from teams and race organizers
3. UCI
Barriers to Adoption:
UCI Race Telemetry Authorization Request: needs to be submitted at least 6 weeks before the beginning of the race

19 Men's World Tour Teams with 12 based in Europe
8 Women's World Teams
19 Pro Teams
170 Men's Continental Teams
47 Women's Continental Teams



## Why SoundHound solution?
Beam forming (when paired with appropriate in ear piece such as the apple air pods?)
- echo cancellation
- emotion detection (could be useful for concussion protocol)
- fingerprint identification
- automatic language translation (official languages of pro peloton are english, french + language of country in which race is being held) , though most riders speak english and/or french, not all do, and riders have varying degrees of fluency
- voice biometrics
- potential for on-device embedded voice interaction
