Partnership for Safety
- Using Houndify, provide hands-free guides on segments, giving the athlete more time to focus on the activity
- point on points of interests, hazards, etc
- using the Strava Beacon feature, automatically call for help in case of an incidence
- concussion protocol?
- emergency services alert protocol?
- emergency contact protocol?

for athletes who travel and may not necessarily know the emergency number to dial in case of an incidence, our system can automatically connect to the emergency services

auto-dial 112 in europe, etc

talk about story of passing out while mountain biking and being knocked out
